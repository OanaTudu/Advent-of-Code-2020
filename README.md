# Advent-of-Code-2020

every year Eric Wastl creates a cool advent calendar of daily coding challenges, which I discovered last year (2019) and done some for the first time. 
As you solve the problems, you can input the correct answer on his page and earn a star for each. You get 2 stars per day (there is a problem with 2 parts for each day). 
It'a a fun thing to do - even though I only have enough time to do some of them. 

Here is a link so you can try them too:

Thank you, Eric (http://was.tl/), for the fun.
